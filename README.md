EchoLink Requirements to Link to N7JN, Cady, on 2M DRAFT Ed K. 11/1/16
Introduction: The goal of the EchoLink project is to allow club members and their friends to remotely access the N7JN 2M repeater on Cady Mt. Because this repeater is the central amateur radio communications channel for the county, both for normal situations and emergencies, it is important that EchoLink add capability to the system with no degradations of the system whatsoever.
